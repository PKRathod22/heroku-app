						<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
						Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices
						(desktops, tablets, and phones). Responsive Web Design is about
						using HTML and CSS to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the
						content to make it look good on any screen: Note: A web page
						should look good on any device. Sometimes it can be difficult to
						get started on a new approach to designing and building websites,
						especially when dealing with Responsive Design and trying to break
						out of the mould. Let this collection of responsive designed
						websites across a variety of website types help get your creative
						and developer juices flowing.

						<h3>HTML5/CSS3</h3>
						HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style
						Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages.
						HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and
						aural) layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and
						scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and
						Web Applications. In this workshop, the first of a three-part
						series, an expert author introduces you to these emerging
						technologies and why they are going to change the world of web
						development. You'll learn how to work with new HTML5 features like
						semantic tags the selector API, new form input controls, improved
						accessibility, and more.

						components and tools organized in an architecture system allowing
						developers to build and maintain complex web application projects

						setting forth folder organization and structure, documentation,
						guidelines and libraries (reusable codes for common functions and
						classes).

						updated.Data is organized into rows, columns and tables, and it is

						updated, expanded and deleted as new information is added.
						Databases process workloads to create and update themselves,
						querying the data they contain and running applications against
						it.

			<h3>Responsive Website</h3>
			<p>In the field of Web design and development, we are quickly
				getting to the point of being unable to keep up with the endless new
				resolutions and devices. For many websites, creating a website
				version for each resolution and new device would be impossible, or
				at least impractical. Should we just suffer the consequences of
				losing visitors from one device, for the benefit of gaining visitors
				from another? Or is there another option?. Responsive Web design is
				the approach that suggests that design and development should
				respond to the users behavior and environment based on screen size,
				platform and orientation.</p>
			<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
			<p>Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the
				world's most popular front-end component library. Bootstrap is an
				open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly
				prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass
				variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt
				components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.</p>
